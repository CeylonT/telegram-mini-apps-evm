# Telegram Mini Apps with EVM Integration Workshop

Welcome to the **Telegram Mini Apps with EVM Integration** workshop repository! This repo provides the necessary resources and examples to help you integrate EVM-based smart contracts with Telegram Mini Apps. Learn how to leverage Telegram's platform alongside the power of Ethereum-compatible blockchains to build seamless, Web3-enabled experiences.

## Introduction

In this workshop, you will learn how to build **Telegram Mini Apps** that interact with **EVM-based blockchains** . We'll guide you through the process of creating mini-apps that allow users to interact with smart contracts directly within Telegram, without needing to leave the app. The goal is to make Web3 interactions more accessible and user-friendly for Telegram users.

We'll also showcase how to integrate wallet functionality into your Telegram bot and how you can send transactions to the blockchain directly from within the chat interface.
